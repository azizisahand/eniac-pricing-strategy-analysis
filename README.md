# Eniac - Product Discount Impact Analysis
## Project Overview
This project delves into Eniac's internal sales and customer data to rigorously analyze the effects of product discounts. The primary goal is to provide data-driven insights to resolve an internal debate between the Marketing Team, who advocate for discounts to boost customer metrics, and the Board, concerned about the impact of aggressive discounting on total revenue and brand positioning.

Using Python, this analysis will explore various facets of discount impact, including:

- Customer Acquisition: Do discounts attract new customers more effectively?

- Customer Satisfaction: How do discounts influence customer perception and feedback?

- Customer Retention: Do discounted purchases lead to higher long-term customer loyalty?

- Revenue Impact: How do discounts affect gross revenue, net revenue, and profitability over time, especially considering the recent observation of increased orders but decreased total revenue?

- Product Performance: Identify which product categories or individual products benefit most (or least) from discounting.

## The Core Debate
- Marketing Team's Hypothesis: Discounts are a strategic tool for enhancing customer acquisition, improving satisfaction, and fostering long-term retention, ultimately contributing to company growth.

- Board's Concern: Recent quarterly results show an increase in order volume but a decline in total revenue, suggesting that aggressive discounting might be eroding profit margins and potentially shifting the company's market position away from a quality-focused segment.

This analysis aims to provide a clear, unbiased perspective to inform future pricing and marketing strategies at Eniac.

## Data Source
The analysis will utilize Eniac's internal, non-anonymized transactional and customer data. This rich dataset will allow for detailed segmentations and a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior in relation to discounted products.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python: The primary language for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

- Pandas: For efficient data handling and transformation.

- NumPy: For numerical operations.

- Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization and reporting.
